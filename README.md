# TodoList

## About
I created this application in Spring of 2020 when I started learning Web Development on my own. It was a project by Web Development course in Udemy instructed by Colt Steele. 

The Todo List Web Application is a simple task tracking app that allows you to add, remove, or mark-done a task. 
In the bottom right corner of the page, you will see a color pallete by which you can change the theme of the application.

## Languages 
Languages used for this app are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## Challenges/What I learnt 
1- The most important challenge I faced was making it responsive, which eventually taught me usage of vw and vh.

2- Another issue was making the themes and stacking the buttons in corner of the page. I learnt about efficient use of classes.

## Further Improvement 
1- I think it would be a good idea to store the data of the user in the browser for a while or even create a sign-in form so that the the user can have access to his/her data in the future.
