# TodoList

## About
I created this application in Spring of 2020 when I started learning Web Development on my own. It was a project by Web Development course in Udemy instructed by Colt Steele. 

The Todo List Web Application is a simple task tracking app that allows you to add, remove, or mark-done a task. 
In the bottom right corner of the page, you will see a color pallete by which you can change the theme of the application.

## Languages 
Languages used for this app are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
